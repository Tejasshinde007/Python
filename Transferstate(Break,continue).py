#1)Break:-we can use break inside the loop execution based on the some condition


#EX:-

# n=7
# for i in range(1,10):
#     if i==n:
#         print("we found 7 and we break loop",i)  #loop is break bcz we found 7 so we break loop by break
#         break
#     print(i)
    


#2)Continue:-we can use continue statement to skip current iteration and continue next iteration


#EX:-

# for i in range(10):
#     if i%2==0:
#         continue
#     print(i)

#3)PASS:-Pass is a keyword in python ,pass is a empty statement,pass is null statement,i you want to define empty block then we should go for the pass

#EX:-

# for i in range(5):
#     pass 


#4)Del:- after using the variable,it is highly recommended to delete that variable if it is no longer required,
#           so that corresponding is into the garbage collection,we can delete variable ussing the del
